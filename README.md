# pyLoRa

It turns out the HopeRF has a family of LoRa capable transceiver chips [RFM92/95/96/98](http://www.hoperf.com/rf/lora/)
that have identical or almost identical SPI interface as the Semtech [SX127x family](http://www.hoperf.com/rf/lora/).

The [pySX127x](https://github.com/mayeranalytics/pySX127x) project will therefore be renamed to pyLoRa soon.
